                    <p>It's not just about producing good quality natural milk from cows. It's about their happiness level. If cows are happy, they produce far better quality milk. Apart from natural fodder and cattle feed we provide, our cows are provided with good housing and space to move around and graze. Their hygiene and health are also taken care of very well by experienced farmers.</p>
