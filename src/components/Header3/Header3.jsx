                    <p>When cows walk around and graze naturally in the open field, they are very healthy. Our Desi Cows are grazed in the forest during the day. They graze natural grass, leaves, and medicinal herbs. Grazing cows in the open field under the sun not only keep cows healthy, but they also give us nutrition-rich milk. Consuming milk and milk products from forest grazed cows is known to have various health benefits.</p>
